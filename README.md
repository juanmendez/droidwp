demo using native android and wordpress admin

This demo is a way for me to do Android development as I became a bit rusty over the last months. 
It is very interesting how reading and following the basic material is helping me to move faster and with more
confidence than in the past. I am breaking the demo into branches that relate to different topics such is the case
of Jackson Jr. Eventually this app will be created to its fullest. I personally belive that the best way to learn
is by doing your own demos rather than just following along from other's workshops.

This demo is also a window to Wordpress. I am going to be creating custom posts, and setting administration there for the backend.
I am interested in what the community has done for <a href="http://wp-api.org/" target="_blank">WP API</a> which can benefit this demo in exchanging data.

It's a very exciting thing to see how different platforms can coexist. Wish me luck.
